0.  BMP supports 32 bit color, so over 4 billion colors. 
    GIF suports 8 bit color, so 256 colors.
    JPEG supports 24 bit color, so over 16 million colors.
    PNG supports 24 bit collor, so over 16 million colors. 
1.  GIF supports animation. 
2.  Lossy compression reduces a file by permanently eliminating certain
    information, such as redudant information (all orginial data cannot be
    recovered when the file is uncompressed). In lossless compression, every
    bit of information within a file when it was compressed can be recovered 
    when it is uncompressed. 
3.  JPEG is lossy compressed.
4.  When a file is delted, its address is forgotten, but the image itself 
    remains on the hard drive. 
5.  To ensures a fie canot be retrieved, use a program that overides the 
    information of where the file was previosuly stored. 
6.  It is a header file that declares that declares integer types of specific 
    size.
7.  Using those specific integer types allows the programmer to specify how he
    she intends to use a variable; with an unisgned int, it relays that negative
    values are not needed, and the numeric value in the type declares of what 
    size the variable will be. 
8.  1, 4, 4, 2 respectviely.
9.  They must be set to the signature 0x4d42.
10. bfSize specifies the size of the bitmap file (in bytes)
	biSize specifies the size of the structure (in bytes)
11. If biHeight is positive, the bitmap is bottom-up and if it is negative, the
    bitmap is a top-down.
12. biBitCount 
13. fopen will return NULL if it cannot creat the otufile to write to; perhaps 
    there was not enough disk space for example. 
14. Becuase we want fread to move over the file one by one with a specific length
15. It assigns 3 to padding to make the scanline a multiple of 4. 
16. It moves the file pointer over by an amount desired. 
17. It sets fseek to begin from the current relative position of the file pointer.
