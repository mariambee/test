chmod 711 <file>
rwx -> 111 -> 7
--x -> 001 -> 1
--x-> 001 -> 1

What if we want give read access to the file?
we need:
rwx -> 111 -> 7
r-- -> 100 -> 4
r---> 100 -> 4
So we would need to execute: chmod 744

Equivalently we woud could run: (chmod a + (r, w, or x) <file>) to grant
permission to that particular option

chmod can be used for any directory 

chmod 644 *.html (*.htm; means apply to any file of .html type)
